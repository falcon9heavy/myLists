# myLists

Examples and tests using lists

Single linked list module.py

Creating a linkedList that I've customized for full use in other programs when required.
Some key things needed are:

    append(value) - add a new value to the end of the list
    count() - returns the total number of nodes in the list
    get(index) - returns the value at the index provided
    show_list() - get a read out of all node values
    insert(index,value) - add a value to specific index
    crypto() - cryptographically store/conceal the data stored in the node
    delete(value) = find that value/values and delete from index
